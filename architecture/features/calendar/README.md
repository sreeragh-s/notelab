# Calendar

Calendar contracts live in [the shared package](../../../packages/features/src/calendar/index.ts). Event identity includes workspace, binding, provider calendar and event. All-day dates use an exclusive end; timed events preserve IANA zones and recurrence identity.

The server requires both `CALENDAR_ENABLED=true` and a matching `CALENDAR_ENABLED_WORKSPACE_IDS` entry (or `*`). The web uses the independent `VITE_FEATURE_CALENDAR` flag, disabled by default. Calendar authorization never follows the Mail flag.

Contract model tests exercise identity isolation and safe route construction. Configuration tests cover independent workspace rollout.
